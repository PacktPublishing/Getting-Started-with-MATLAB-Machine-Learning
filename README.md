## About the Video Course
MATLAB is the language of choice for many researchers and mathematics experts when it comes to machine learning. This video will help beginners build a foundation in machine learning using MATLAB. You'll start by getting your system ready with the MATLAB environment for machine learning and you'll see how to easily interact with the MATLAB workspace. You'll then move on to data cleansing, mining, and analyzing various data types in machine learning and you'll see how to display data values on a plot. Next, you'll learn about the different types of regression technique and how to apply them to your data using the MATLAB functions. You'll understand the basic concepts of neural networks and perform data fitting, pattern recognition, and clustering analysis. Finally, you'll explore feature selection and extraction techniques for dimensionality reduction to improve performance. By the end of the video, you'll have learned to put it all together via real-world use cases covering the major machine learning algorithms and will be comfortable in performing machine learning with MATLAB.
